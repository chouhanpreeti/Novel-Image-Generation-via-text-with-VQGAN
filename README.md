# Novel-Image-Genertion-via-text-with-VQGAN #

Novel Image Generation via text prompts using VQGAN (Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks). VQGAN is a generative model for image modeling and is an update over VQ-VAE architecture.

## Project Overview ##

## Dataset ##
Common Object in Context (COCO) Dataset is used for the model training to increase the model generalization to text prompts.
